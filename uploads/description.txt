-- Features required for ML model --

* GRE Score

* College Ranking 
* SOP Score
* LOR Score
* CGPA Score

-- LOGIC --

* Saved the trained model in h5 format
* Loaded the model using tensorflow library
* Created a form using flask_wtforms library
* After taking all the features from the form all the features are 
    * converted to tensorflow tensors datatype with shape (1, 6)
    * and then scaled using MinMaxScalar class from sklearn library

    '''
        input_vec = scaler.transform(tf.constant([gre_score, toefl_score, rating_score, sop_score, lor_score, cgpa_score], shape=[1, 6]))
    '''

* The created tensor is passed to model.predict()
* The result given by the model is displayed using render_template method from flask using a html file
